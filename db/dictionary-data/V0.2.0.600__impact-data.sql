This development pathway leads to a future where society is able to relatively easily mitigate or adapt to climate change. There are a high rate of economic growth, declining population growth, and increasing levels of education globally.', '0'),

Environmental degradation continues but at a slowing pace. There is general improvement, but it is much slower than that seen in SSP 1. Climate change presents moderate challenges to both adaptation and mitigation.', '1'),

Barriers to trade increase, and countries tend to look inward at the expense of global cooperation. There are lower levels of technological change. Economic development is slow, and population growth is higher. Climate change presents significant challenges for both adaptation and mitigation.', '0')
