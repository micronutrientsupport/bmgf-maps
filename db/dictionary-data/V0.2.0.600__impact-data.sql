Climate change presents moderate challenges to both adaptation and mitigation.'),

Barriers to trade increase, and countries tend to look inward at the expense of global cooperation. There are lower levels of technological change. Economic development is slow, and population growth is higher. Climate change presents significant challenges for both adaptation and mitigation.')
